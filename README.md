## Magic The Gathering Marketplace

Team Members: Sherri, Bayli, Joseph, Ifeanyi

API’s we are going to use: https://magicthegathering.io/ and https://scryfall.com/ API'S

Our database is a quick lookup for the type, cost, colour, and the card market price from the api’s we listed above. We will have 3 buttons and a search bar for the card you want to view. Our site will be responsive on phones, and tablets. 

We will have sort functions, search option. When we click on the header all the options will reset. Hyper links to all the sellers, to eBay, amazon, and card kingdoms.

We also have a some mobile responsive 

### How the Application works

We use the magicthegathering.io api for displaying cards and we use the scryfall.com api to display the ebay and amazon page links. When you get to the website you will have a search menu with filters such as: Color, Type, Mana Cost, and Name of the card. When you have the search critera you need you can press search and it will give you all the cards you are looking for with those filters that match your critera. If no cards are found the result section will be empty. 

By default you will see the 100 cards of any color, type and cost from magicthegathering.io. If there is no image for the card we do not show the card on the website.

You are also givin a option to click on the amazon and ebay icons to buy the card if you choose so.
